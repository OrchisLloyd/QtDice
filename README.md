This is a project only for fun and learning purposes. I wanted to mess with Qt5, C++ and cmake's options/conditional compilation.
I inscribed this application to my girlfriend, who tolerates my amount of time being spent on learning C++.

This project doesn't pretend to be written by an expert but you are free to read, borrow or modify the code for whatever reason you like. 
Of course c&c or opening issues are welcome.
