This is a project only for fun and learning purposes. I wanted to mess with Qt5, C++ and cmake's options and conditional compilation. 
I inscribed this application to my girlfriend, who tolerates my amount of time being spent on learning C++.

You are free to read, borrow or modify the code for whatever reason you like. Of course c&c are welcome as well opening issues.
